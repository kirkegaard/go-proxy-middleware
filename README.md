# Go proxy with middleware

Just for learning purpose, I'm creating a simple Go proxy server with
middleware that handles cache and logging.

## TODO
- [x] Add cache middleware
- [x] Add logging middleware
- [ ] Figure out how to handle cache headers
- [ ] Get rid of the header copying
- [ ] Add tests
